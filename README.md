The learning models are experimental, most did not work properly.

The tested models are in the YOLO models -- it has variations of the same models

The most recent model is in the current_YOLO_model folder -- it has a different video, and can track who exits AND who enters. To change the video footage, you must upload a new .mp4 file. 

I am working on a way to use a YT livestream to feed into the algorithm so that the user can count IRL

You can also use live CCTV camera footage in the algorithm
